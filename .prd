PRD: Zero-blocking startup - all installations async after nginx

STATUS: Implementation complete, awaiting live system test before push

COMPLETED ITEMS:
✓ 1. Remove Phase 0-apt from custom_startup.sh (DONE)
✓ 2. Add Phase 0 (async) note to custom_startup.sh (DONE)
✓ 3. Add APT package installation to rest-of-startup.sh Phase 0 (DONE)
✓ 4. Verify rest-of-startup.sh flow (DONE)
✓ 5. Validate bash syntax (DONE - all scripts pass)
✓ 6. Commit changes locally (DONE - commit b3315bf)

PENDING ITEMS:

7. Live system test verification
   BLOCKING: Push to remote
   TEST POINTS:
   - nginx starts by ~15-17 seconds (check logs)
   - /desk available by ~18-20 seconds (curl http://localhost/desk/)
   - No apt-get commands in first 15 seconds of logs
   - APT packages install AFTER "BLOCKING STARTUP COMPLETE"
   - Services become healthy within ~60s
   - No errors in startup logs

   TEST COMMANDS:
   ```bash
   # Rebuild image
   docker build -t gmweb:latest .

   # Monitor startup
   tail -f /config/logs/startup.log

   # Verify /desk loads early (after ~18s)
   curl -s http://localhost/desk/ | head -20

   # Check APT timing
   grep "Phase 0: Installing system packages" /config/logs/startup.log
   ```

   PASS CRITERIA:
   ✓ /desk available within 20 seconds
   ✓ nginx listening by 17 seconds
   ✓ No APT installs during blocking phase
   ✓ All services healthy after 60s
   ✓ No critical errors

   RESULT: [PENDING - awaiting test execution]

8. Push to remote
   BLOCKED BY: Item 7 (test verification)
   ACTION: After test passes, run:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   RESULT: [PENDING - blocked by test]

CURRENT GIT STATUS:
- Unpushed commits: 1 (b3315bf - "Fix: Move all APT installations to async rest-of-startup.sh")
- Changes: All committed locally, NOT pushed
- Ready for: Live system test

DO NOT PUSH YET
Test on live system first to confirm everything works as expected.
Once test passes all criteria, then push to remote.
