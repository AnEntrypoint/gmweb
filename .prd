## COMPLETED: ELIMINATE DOCKERFILE MAINTENANCE

### PHASE 1: CREATE UNIFIED STARTUP SCRIPT ✓
- [x] Created /startup.sh combining all logic
  * 276 lines, includes Dockerfile setup + install.sh + custom_startup.sh
  * All 7 phases present: setup, packages, D-Bus, nginx, Node.js, supervisor, background
  * Bash syntax verified

### PHASE 2: UPDATE DOCKERFILE ✓
- [x] Minimized to 3 lines: FROM lscr.io/linuxserver/webtop:ubuntu-xfce + EXPOSE
- [x] Removed all RUN commands (moved to startup.sh)
- [x] Removed custom init hook setup (using docker-compose command instead)

### PHASE 3: UPDATE DOCKER-COMPOSE ✓
- [x] Changed to use lscr.io/linuxserver/webtop:ubuntu-xfce directly (no build)
- [x] Added command: bash -c "curl ... startup.sh | bash"
- [x] All volumes and environment preserved
- [x] No build section needed

### PHASE 4: VERIFY ✓
- [x] startup.sh syntax valid
- [x] All phases present in startup.sh
- [x] nginx auth configured FIRST (before services)
- [x] Supervisor startup blocking
- [x] Background tasks non-blocking (CLI tools, ttyd)
- [x] Git clone from https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/gmweb/main

### KEY BENEFITS
✓ No Dockerfile maintenance needed
✓ startup.sh is single source of truth
✓ Can be called directly from GitHub in docker-compose
✓ All updates happen at runtime (no image rebuild)
✓ nginx routing configured before services start
✓ Desktop starts without waiting for background installs
✓ System is idempotent - can restart safely

### REMOVED FILES/LOGIC
- docker/custom_startup.sh (logic merged into startup.sh)
- Most Dockerfile RUN commands (logic merged into startup.sh)
- docker/install.sh (logic merged into startup.sh)
- custom-cont-init.d setup (using docker-compose command instead)
