.prd: WebRTC deployment - critical bugs fixed, ready for final testing

CRITICAL BUGS FOUND & FIXED:

BUG #1: Grep syntax error in patch-selkies-webrtc.sh
- Commit: 2ec48ed
- Issue: grep -q '--mode="webrtc"' treated dashes as option instead of pattern
- Fix: Changed to grep -q 'mode="webrtc"'
- Impact: Selkies patch verification now passes correctly

BUG #2: background-installs.sh blocking supervisor startup (CRITICAL)
- Commit: 1661600
- Issue: rest-of-startup.sh Phase 5 called background-installs BLOCKING
- Impact: background-installs has 5-10 min recursive find operations
- Consequence: Supervisor never started, all services remain disabled, /desk/ unavailable
- Fix: Reorder phases - supervisor starts immediately after XFCE
- Result: background-installs now spawned async with nohup &

CURRENT STATE:
- All critical bugs fixed and pushed to origin/main
- Ready for Docker rebuild and redeploy
- Expected boot time: 60-70 seconds (vs. hanging indefinitely)

FINAL TESTING ITEMS (after redeploy):

Item 1: Verify fresh deployment with all fixes
  - Rebuild Docker image with latest commits
  - Deploy new container
  - Monitor startup logs for successful completion
  - Verify all phases complete within 90 seconds

Item 2: Test /desk endpoint returns WebRTC interface (not 404)
  - Test: http://localhost/desk/
  - Expected: 200 OK with Selkies interface HTML
  - Verify: No 404 or 426 errors

Item 3: Test live domain https://buildesk.acc.l-inc.co.za/desk/
  - Navigate to: https://buildesk.acc.l-inc.co.za/desk/
  - Verify: Page loads (not 404)
  - Verify: Selkies WebRTC interface visible
  - Verify: No console errors

Item 4: Test WebRTC connection and video streaming
  - Verify: WebRTC connection established
  - Verify: Desktop video stream visible
  - Verify: Mouse/keyboard input responsive
  - Monitor: Stable connection (no reconnections)

Item 5: Verify other endpoints working
  - Test: /files/, /ssh/, /gm/, / endpoints
  - Verify: All services healthy
  - Verify: No regressions from fixes

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (all must pass):
✓ Docker builds without errors
✓ Container boots within 90 seconds
✓ Supervisor starts successfully
✓ /desk/ endpoint responds (not 404)
✓ Live domain loads WebRTC interface
✓ Video streaming works
✓ Input responsive
✓ All other endpoints functional
✓ No errors in logs

NEXT ACTION: User deploys fresh Docker image with fixes (commits 2ec48ed, 1661600, etc.)
Then execute Items 1-5 to verify complete functionality
