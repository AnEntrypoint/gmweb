PRD: Zero-blocking startup - all installations async after nginx

GOAL:
nginx-first blocking architecture with ZERO installations before nginx starts
After nginx is ready, ALL remaining work (git, APT packages, NVM, supervisor, services) runs async
/desk available in ~15-20 seconds with nothing blocking

PRINCIPLE:
- custom_startup.sh Phase 0 (BLOCKING): permissions ONLY
- custom_startup.sh Phase 0 (BLOCKING): nginx-setup.sh
- custom_startup.sh Phase 1 (NON-BLOCKING): spawn rest-of-startup.sh
- rest-of-startup.sh (ASYNC): APT packages + git + NVM + supervisor + services

NO APT packages in custom_startup.sh
NO APT packages in Dockerfile (pre-install violates principle)
ALL APT packages in rest-of-startup.sh (Phase 0 before git clone)

WORK ITEMS (dependency chain):

BLOCKING PHASE (custom_startup.sh):
1. Remove Phase 0-apt from custom_startup.sh
   - DELETE lines 105-115 (apt-get update, install unzip jq ttyd)
   - Remove log messages about APT phase
   - Result: custom_startup.sh has ZERO apt-get commands
   - BLOCKS: Nothing (independent)

2. Add Phase 0 (async) note to custom_startup.sh
   - Add log message: "All system packages install async after nginx in rest-of-startup.sh"
   - Result: clear documentation
   - BLOCKS: Nothing

ASYNC PHASE (rest-of-startup.sh - runs after nginx):
3. Add APT package installation to rest-of-startup.sh Phase 0
   - Install before git clone (packages needed by git operations)
   - apt-get update
   - apt-get install -y unzip jq ttyd
   - Result: packages available before git clone
   - BLOCKS: git clone phase
   - BLOCKED BY: nginx completion (implicit via spawning)

4. Verify rest-of-startup.sh flow
   - Phase 0: APT packages (new)
   - Phase 1: git clone
   - Phase 2: NVM setup
   - Phase 3: supervisor setup
   - Phase 4: XFCE launcher
   - Phase 5: background-installs.sh (gcloud, gh, modules)
   - Result: everything async, nothing blocking nginx
   - BLOCKS: Nothing
   - BLOCKED BY: APT installation (Phase 0)

VERIFICATION:
5. Validate bash syntax
   - bash -n custom_startup.sh
   - bash -n rest-of-startup.sh
   - Result: no syntax errors
   - BLOCKS: commit
   - BLOCKED BY: file modifications

6. Commit changes
   - git add docker/custom_startup.sh docker/rest-of-startup.sh
   - git commit -m "Fix: Move all APT installations to async rest-of-startup.sh"
   - Message: explains zero-blocking principle
   - Result: changes in git
   - BLOCKS: push
   - BLOCKED BY: validation

7. Push to remote
   - git push origin main
   - Result: changes on remote
   - BLOCKS: nothing
   - BLOCKED BY: commit

PARALLEL WAVES:
Wave 1 (independent):
- Item 1: Remove Phase 0-apt from custom_startup.sh
- Item 2: Add note about async packages
- Item 3: Add APT phase to rest-of-startup.sh
- Item 4: Verify flow

Wave 2 (dependent on Wave 1):
- Item 5: Validate syntax
- Item 6: Commit
- Item 7: Push

EXPECTED RESULT:
✓ custom_startup.sh: ZERO apt-get commands
✓ custom_startup.sh: permissions → nginx-setup → spawn async
✓ rest-of-startup.sh: APT packages → git → NVM → supervisor → services
✓ nginx blocking phase: ~15 seconds (permissions + nginx-setup only)
✓ /desk available at ~15-20 seconds
✓ Everything else runs async in background
✓ No installations blocking nginx whatsoever

CRITICAL CHECKLIST:
- NO apt-get in custom_startup.sh ✗ (will be done)
- NO apt-get update in custom_startup.sh ✗ (will be done)
- ALL APT packages in rest-of-startup.sh ✗ (will be done)
- nginx-first blocking ✓ (already working)
- Everything else async ✓ (already working)
- Clean separation of concerns ✗ (will be done)
