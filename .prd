## COMPLETED WORK

- [x] opencode service spawns 'opencode acp' - f52e637
  * spawn(['acp']) runs opencode acp as detached process
  * Logs to [opencode:acp] with stdout/stderr tracking
  
- [x] AionUI location verified at /config/workspace/aionui
  * Code already set to this path (AIONUI_DIR variable)
  * Hardcoded /opt/AionUi/AionUi reference fixed to use AIONUI_BINARY variable
  
- [x] AionUI force-updates on every boot
  * Added force-clean: sudo rm -rf AIONUI_DIR DEB_PATH before download
  * Ensures fresh download+extract every boot
  * Persists in /config/workspace/aionui volume for manipulation
  
- [x] bcrypt and package.json verified
  * bcrypt installed to /config/.gmweb-deps (correct, not /config/node_modules)
  * /config/.gmweb-deps/package.json is isolated
  * No /config/package.json or /config/node_modules pollution
  
## VERIFICATION STATUS
✓ Syntax valid for all files
✓ No /config/node_modules bloat
✓ AionUI updates on boot
✓ opencode acp starts correctly
✓ All paths use correct variables (no hardcoding)
