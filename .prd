# Outstanding Issues to Fix

## Issue 1: WebSSH2/XFCE terminal starting in wrong working directory
- Terminal opens in /opt subdirectory instead of home (/config)
- webssh2.js line 35 has cwd: '/config' which is correct
- Issue is likely in XFCE terminal emulator not respecting PWD or HOME not being set when XFCE components launch
- Fix: Add HOME export and cd to HOME in XFCE launcher script and ensure tmux/bash defaults to HOME

## Issue 2: AionUI password credentials not applying
- setCredentialsFromEnv() fails because better-sqlite3 cannot be found
- Error: "Cannot find module '/config/nvm/versions/node/v24.13.0/lib/node_modules/better-sqlite3'"
- Root cause: Using incorrect path calculation for global node_modules, should use npm root -g or simpler approach
- Fix: Install better-sqlite3 at container level or use direct npm search instead of GLOBAL_MODULES path construction

## Issue 3: npm cache permissions for file-manager
- file-manager service failing with "Your cache folder contains root-owned files"
- Need to ensure npm cache is properly owned by abc user

## Status
- [ ] Fix webssh2 terminal working directory
- [ ] Fix AionUI password credential setup
- [ ] Fix npm cache permissions
