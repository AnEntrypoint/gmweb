PRD: Zero-blocking startup - ready for live system test

STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE - Ready to rebuild and test on live system

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
✓ custom_startup.sh: Removed ALL apt-get commands (zero blocking before nginx)
✓ rest-of-startup.sh: Added Phase 0 APT installation (runs async after nginx)
✓ All bash syntax validated
✓ Changes committed and pushed (commits b3315bf, 3f2d0f4)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER REBUILD/REBOOT:
- nginx-first blocking: ~15-20 seconds (permissions + nginx-setup only)
- /desk available: ~18-20 seconds with NOTHING blocking
- APT packages: Install async in background while nginx and s6-rc proceed
- No installations blocking nginx whatsoever

TEST PLAN:
1. Rebuild Docker image: docker build -t gmweb:latest .
2. Monitor startup: tail -f /config/logs/startup.log
3. Wait for: "BLOCKING STARTUP COMPLETE" (~18s)
4. Test /desk: curl -s http://localhost/desk/ | head -20
5. Verify APT timing: grep "Phase 0: Installing system packages" /config/logs/startup.log

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✓ /desk available within 20 seconds
✓ nginx listening by 17 seconds
✓ No APT installs during blocking phase (first 20s)
✓ Services healthy within 60-70s

NEXT STEP:
Execute live system test and report results. PRD will be cleared once test passes.
